This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Web.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

* [/webApp](./webApp) contains web React application. It uses the Kotlin/JS library produced
  by the [shared](./shared) module.

### Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which includes `npm`)
2. Build Kotlin/JS shared code:
   - on macOS/Linux
     ```shell
     ./gradlew :shared:jsBrowserDevelopmentLibraryDistribution
     ```
   - on Windows
     ```shell
     .\gradlew.bat :shared:jsBrowserDevelopmentLibraryDistribution
     ```
3. Build and run the web application
